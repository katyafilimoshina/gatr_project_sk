# Geometric Algebra Transformers

This is repository of the project "Equivariant Transformer Architecture Based on Clifford Geometric Algebras" for the Skoltech course Modern Methods and Algorithms of Generative Artificial Intelligence.

This project considers and experiments with the
[**Geometric Algebra Transformer**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18415) by
Johann Brehmer, Pim de Haan, Sönke Behrends, and Taco Cohen,
published at NeurIPS 2023.
